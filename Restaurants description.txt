This survey was conducted in 1980 by the University of Wisconsin Small
Business Development Center. The purpose was ``to develop data that would
be useful to small business counselors in advising managers as to how to
effectively plan and operate their small restaurants''.

Nineteen of Wisconsin's counties were selected for study. Lists of
restaurants were drawn up from telephone directories and these were
sampled in proportion to the population of the county. A sample of 1000
restaurants yielded 279 usable responses. The data base thus consists of
279 summaries of the returned questionnaires. Some respondents failed to
present complete answers. Thus, there are a number of missing values,
which are coded by ".".
